Between the linear and quadratic fits it looks like the quadratic function is a better fit, as the fit line is closer to most data points.

Q-estimator output:

Linear:
chi2/N  =       1.979470 (ndf = 28)
chi2    =       55.425159
Q       =       1.510649e-03

Quadratic:
chi2/N  =       0.912381 (ndf = 27)
chi2    =       24.634287
Q       =       5.949490e-01
